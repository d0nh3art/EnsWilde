# EnsWilde (Mobile)

**EnsWilde** is a tool utilizing `itunesstored` & `bookassetd` exploits, designed for iPhone and iPad running the latest **iOS Version 26.2b1**.

It operates as a standalone on-device application, functioning independently like modern apps. It leverages the `sparserestore` exploit to write data to files situated outside of the intended restore location.

## Getting Your .mobiledevicepairing File
There are two supported ways to obtain a pairing file:

### Option 1 — Generate it with jitterbugpair (recommended)
1.  Download `jitterbugpair` for your operating system here: [Jitterbug Releases](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/latest)
    * **Note:** On Mac or Linux, you may need to make it executable first:
        ```bash
        chmod +x ./jitterbugpair
        ```
2.  Run the program (double-click it or run it via Terminal/PowerShell).
3.  Share the generated `.mobiledevicepairing` file to your iOS device (AirDrop, Files, etc.).
4.  Open **EnsWilde** and select the pairing file.

*You should only have to do this once, unless you lose the file or delete the app’s data.*

---

### Option 2 — Pick the pairing file directly from SideStore’s folder
If you already imported/placed a pairing file for SideStore, it’s typically stored in SideStore’s on-device folder.

1. Open **Files** on your iPhone/iPad
2. Go to **Browse** → **On My iPhone/iPad** → **SideStore**
3. Find the file ending in **`.mobiledevicepairing`**
4. Open **EnsWilde** and select that file directly from the SideStore folder

## Setting Up VPN
1.  Download **LocaldevVPN** from the iOS App Store.
2.  Enable the VPN within that app.
3.  Launch **EnsWilde**.
